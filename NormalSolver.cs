 * 
 * Modifications in the derived version:
 * 
 *  - Averaged normals are calculated as a weighted average based on face area,
 *    known as "face weighted normals" or "area weighted normals".
 * 
 *  - An ignoreFactor parameter has been added which can cull normals from the average
 *    if their weight is smaller than a certain fraction of the largest weight.
 *    This can be used to make large faces completely flat, distributing the curvature
 *    completely to adjacent smaller faces.
